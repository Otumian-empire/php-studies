				Did you know that there is a formal method of proof,
				know as the proof by contradiction?
				For an instance, cases where we normally have two sides,
				say a coin toss. Prove a coin toss is a head. To show that,
				we first assume that the coin toss is not a head, that is,
				 it is a tail. So in all the hustling and brain craking..
				 All you have to do is create a contradition.
